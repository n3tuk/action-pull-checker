# When working with Dependabot and GitHub Actions, where those Actions can make
# changes to documentation or code based on updates to the repository's
# dependencies, it is always necessary for the pull requests to go though
# multiple stagings using the force-ci-run label. These rules take this into
# account and allow those stages to be managed and triggered as necessary.

pull_request_rules:

  # If the pull request was raised by Dependabot, and only Dependabot or GitHub
  # Actions have make changes to the branch, then automatically approve if it's
  # not in conflict with the base branch.
